# Presentations

Giant Swarm's private presentation repository.

This repository contains presentations as mark down files and tooling
to export them to HTML or PDF.

If you want to present offline, or send a presentation to someone, take a look at
the exports folder. In it, all presentations are available as a downloadable
zip file, or pdf files.

Take a look in `content` to see what presentations there are. Each presentation
is contained entirely in one `markdown` file. Subfolders can be used for
some grouping and organization.

If you want to edit the look and feel of the presentations then take a peak in
the `layout` folder.

## Getting started

Make sure you have `nodejs` installed, then just `npm install`

When you want to build the presentations, run `make`
